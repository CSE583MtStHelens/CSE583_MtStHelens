# User Story

The User is a seismological researcher. They want to apply our tool to their specific data. The purpose of our data is to finding underground changes in terms of attenuations and to find correlations between the attenuations and external time series. Their data can be any preprocessed seismological data with same data structure as out data.  
They want the tool to be easy to use and the input data should be scalable in time and space. The expected user skill is to distinguish the differences between their used data structure and the data structure used in our tool, and basic python skills to do basic pre-processing process of their data.
