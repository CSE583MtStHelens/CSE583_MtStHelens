## Data structure
This project is structured in the way that we have a folder ```code``` where you can find the jupyter notebooks or python scripts. The folder ```data``` contains some example files. In our case we do have .csv files of the preprocessed seismic data. Each file contains the data of one seismic station and one year. The column headers indicate different parameters extracted from seismic time series. The rows represent time windows of 10 minutes. The ```doc``` folder contains some informations about the project.<br>
